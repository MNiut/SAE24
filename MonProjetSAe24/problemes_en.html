        <h2>The Challenges of the SAÃ©24 Project</h2>
        <p>
            Every technical project has its share of challenges. 
			This page documents the main obstacles we encountered and the solutions we implemented to overcome them.
        </p>

        <!-- Section for Windows Server issues -->
        <h3>DHCP Server Conflict</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> At the beginning of the project, 
			our client machines were not getting IP addresses from our Windows Server, 
			but were receiving them from the lab's network.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> By isolating our topology on a dedicated vSwitch in ESXi 
			and using client machines physically connected only to our own switch, 
			we created an isolated network environment where our DHCP server was the sole master.
        </p>

        <!-- Section for Intersite Telephony issues -->
        <h3>SIP Trunk Configuration for Intersite Telephony</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Phone calls between our Asterisk servers would not go through. 
			Analyzing the logs (<em>asterisk -rvvv</em>) revealed an authentication error.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> The issue stemmed from an inconsistency in the "secrets" (passwords) 
			and "contexts" defined in each server's <em>sip.conf</em> file. 
			After rigorous coordination with the other team, the calls could be established.
        </p>

        <!-- Section for Project Management issues -->
        <h3>Time Management and Task Dependencies</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> We had underestimated the time required for configuring the Linux services, 
			which delayed the start of the website development.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> We readjusted our Gantt chart. 
			The person in charge of the website started HTML/CSS development locally (using XAMPP) 
			without waiting for the server to be 100% ready. 
			This parallelization of tasks allowed us to catch up.
